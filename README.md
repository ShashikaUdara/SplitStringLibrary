# SplitStringLibrary

In C++, one of the time consuming things to do is string manipulation. This repo is dedicated to minimize the redundent work and enhance the productivity of coding. 
Hope to add more capabilities to the library further.

For now I'm maintaining seperate .h and .cpp for the library, as it optimize and grow, I'll merge them togather as a single file.

main function if just for testing purposes.

Please find following commands to compile and run the code

To Compile: g++ main.cpp StrSplit.cpp StrSplit.h -o splitString

Run in Linux: ./splitString

Run in Windows: splitString.exe
